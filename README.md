# Train-Scheduler

This website allows the user to input information regarding a specific train into a form in the browser and then receive information regarding the arrival of the next train and the minutes left until the next train arrives.  

Specifically, the user will type in:
1. The name of the train
2. The destination of the train
3. The time the first train of the day leaves
4. The frequency with which the train runs

When the users submits this information in the form provided they will receive:
1. The next arrival time of the train
2. The number (in minutes) until the next train arrives

This project is excellent for anyone new to coding who would like to take a look at the workings of an algorithm.  In the case of this project, and algorithm was used to produce the arrival time of the next train and the number of minutes until the next train arrives.  Neither of these pieces of information were hard-coded, rather they came from an algorithm involving some simple math and moment.js.

Thank you for taking a look at my project!
